In a REST API, HTTP responses are how the server communicates the result of a client’s request. Each response contains a **status code**, headers, and optionally, a body. The **status code** informs the client of the outcome—whether the request was successful, resulted in an error, or requires further action. REST APIs __should__ rely on standard HTTP status codes to signal success (2xx), client errors (4xx), and server errors (5xx). The **headers** provide additional information like content type or caching details, while the **body** (if present) includes the data requested by the client, such as JSON or XML objects, error messages, or other relevant information. Clear and consistent HTTP responses are critical for ensuring that clients can correctly interpret and respond to the server's feedback.
